    "## The number _pi_ ($\\pi$)\n",
    "The number $\\pi$ is a mathematical constant. Originally defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics. It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter __\"$\\pi$\"__ since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as \"pi\". It is also called Archimedes' constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being an irrational number, $\\pi$ cannot be expressed as a common fraction (equivalently, its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanently repeating pattern). "

    "## What is the logic behind computing pi by throwing dart randomly?\n",
    "Imagine a square dartboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the dartboard with a circle drawn inside it touching all its sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then, you throw darts at it. Randomly. That means some fall inside the circle, some outside. But assume that no dart falls outside the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "![boards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tirthajyoti/Stats-Maths-with-Python/master/images/boards.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of your dart throwing session, you count the fraction of darts that fell inside the circle of the total number of darts thrown. Multiply that number by 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting number should be pi. Or, a close approximation if you had thrown a lot of darts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is extremely simple. If you throw a large number of darts, then the **probability of a dart falling inside the circle is just the ratio of the area of the circle to that of the area of the square board**. With the help of basic mathematics, you can show that this ratio turns out to be pi/4. So, to get pi, you just multiply that number by 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is to simulate the throwing of a lot of darts so as to make the fraction equal to the probability, an assertion valid only in the limit of a large number of trials of this random event. This comes from the [law of large number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) or the [frequentist definition of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability).\n",
